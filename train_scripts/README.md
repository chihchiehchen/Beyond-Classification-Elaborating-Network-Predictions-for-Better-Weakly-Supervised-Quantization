For the training data, we use selected cases from [RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-intracranial-hemorrhage-detection)

For the test data, we test on the [BHSD dataset](https://github.com/White65534/BHSD). For the preprocessing, use [nii_to_png_3ch](../nii_to_png_3ch utils/transfer_to_png.py)
